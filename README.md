# things I would like todo
- Add in AJAX for deleting posts, other possible applications.
- Finish commenting feature.
- Clean up css implementation. Kind of just added what I needed at the time.
- More predictablility in my code. Sometimes some stuff I mean to change doesn't and sometimes the code can be hard to follow.
- Clean up a lot of extraneous lines of code and get used to making this more modular so this isn't as big of a problem.
- Change the way my database works. It's really strange right now.
